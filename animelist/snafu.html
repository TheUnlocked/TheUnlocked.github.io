    <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/my-teen-romantic-comedy-snafu">Link to SNAFU on Crunchyroll</a> Make sure you watch season 1 first. Crunchyroll has a weird way of displaying its anime.<br />
    <a href="http://mangafox.me/manga/yahari_ore_no_seishun_rabukome_wa_machigatte_iru_mougenroku/">Direct link to manga (via mangafox).</a> Sorry NA residents: You need a VPN for this one, as I couldn't find the manga on mangareader. I would say don't bother reading the manga though.
