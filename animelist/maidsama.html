	The anime ends at chapter 32 in the manga, but everything that happens in the anime has happened in the manga by chapter 35. Basically, the anime ends at chapter 32 if you're fine repeating some content. The anime ends at chapter 35 if you're not.

	Highlight the line below in order to see spoilery advice about reading the manga <br>
	<span style="background-color: #000000">Note that the end (contained only in the manga) is a little disappointing if you enjoy realism in your slice of life. It's not bad though, and I would suggest reading the manga despite it if you can handle a quick "get-together-and-marry" ending.</span>
