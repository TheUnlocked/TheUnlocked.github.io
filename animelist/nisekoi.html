    <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/nisekoi">Link to anime on Crunchyroll</a> <br> Make sure you watch season 1 first. Crunchyroll has a weird way of displaying its anime.<br />
    <a href="http://www.mangareader.net/nisekoi">Link to manga (via mangareader).</a> <br>
	I personally haven't read the manga (the anime has been going for the last 2 years so I assume it will have at least a third season. I'm waiting for it) but I thing I saw somewhere that the manga continues the story past the anime if you don't want to wait for more anime.
