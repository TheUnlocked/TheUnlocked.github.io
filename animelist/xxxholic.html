	Definitely read the manga. It's really good.

	xxxHolic has a reboot series called xxxHolic: Rei. I haven't had the enjoyment of reading it yet but if it's even close to as good as xxxHolic (which it should be if it's made by CLAMP), then it can't be that bad.

	If it feels like this page is very similar to the tsubasa page, that's because this is pretty much a sister series to tsubasa.

	There is no direct link to the anime, but I'm sure you can find it fairly easily if you look around for it. I can't suggest the anime as I have not watched it, but it can't be too awful, right?
