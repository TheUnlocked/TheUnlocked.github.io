	In Japaneese, it's "ツバサ - RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE", in case anyone wanted to know that.

	Definitely read the manga. It's really good.

	There is no direct link to the anime, but I'm sure you can find it fairly easily if you look around for it. I can't suggest the anime as I have not watched it, but it can't be too awful, right?
