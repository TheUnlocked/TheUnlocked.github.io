	Make sure you watch season 1 first. Crunchyroll has a weird way of displaying its anime.
	I do not know when the extra edition episode takes place (I have not watched it), but it came out between the release of SAO and SAO2 <br><br>
	<a href="http://www.watchsao.me/sword-art-offline/">Link to Sword Art Offline</a> <br>
	Sword Art Offline is a parody news show that was shipped with the SAO and SAO2 DVD/BluRays. It's very very funny. Just don't watch it before you watch the actual show. <br> <br>
	This series has manga, but don't bother with it. If you really want it, just go to mangareader and check it out. It only seems to go to half-way through the first season of anime, and even that feels accelerated. If you want to read it instead, you may be able to find the light novels in English if you like that kind of thing.
