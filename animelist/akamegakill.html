    <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/akame-ga-kill">Link to anime on crunchyroll</a> Please note that the anime has its own original ending. More info on this below.<br />
	At the time of posting, the following mangas appear to have incomplete scanlations. Please be patient with the scanlators.<br>
    <a href="http://www.mangareader.net/akame-ga-kiru">Link to manga (via mangareader).</a> <br>
	Due to the fact that the anime has an alternate ending, there is no place where the anime ends and the manga continues. However, I have heard that chapter 39 (right after episode 19) is a good place to pick up from.
